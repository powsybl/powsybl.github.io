# Release Cycle

A new release train of the framework occurs roughly every 2 to 3 months.

In order to get more details about our release train, visit our [documentation page](https://powsybl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releasetrain.html).

In case of structural issues, corrective releases can also be published for some repositories.

Furthermore, there is always a possibility to release a module outside the planned release trains if necessary.

We ensure the release of our most used components in our release train but the list can evolve as users' demand does.

In any case, please don't hesitate to [contact us](../community/index.md#contact) for further discussion.

You can also participate in our [TSC meetings](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/powsybl-tsc/) for your voice to be heard.
