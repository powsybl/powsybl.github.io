We use the [PowSyBl Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/powsybl/shared_invite/zt-rzvbuzjk-nxi0boim1RKPS5PjieI0rA) organization for all chat. 

**This is the first place to come if you think you've found a bug in PowSyBl or if you want to suggest an enhancement**.

You can also join to discuss or ask any question about PowSyBl.
