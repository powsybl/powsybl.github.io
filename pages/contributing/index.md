Please report unacceptable behavior to the projectâ€™s Technical Steering Committee powsybl-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org.

## License
PowSyBl is an open source framework licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](../project/license.md). By contributing to PowSyBl, you accept and agree to the terms and conditions for your present and future contributions submitted to PowSyBl.

## Developer Certificate of Origin
The project also uses a mechanism known as a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to manage the process of ensuring that we are legally allowed to distribute all the code and assets for the project. A DCO is a legally binding statement that asserts that you are the creator of your contribution, and that you wish to allow PowSyBl to use your work.
Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages.
Please find more details about DCO in our [guidelines](https://github.com/powsybl/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#dco).

## Code quality
The Continuous Integration (CI) runs automatically when a pull request is opened, or a commit is pushed. It helps us maintain the quality of the code with automatic checks on:
- Code style;
- Compilation;
- Code smells, duplication, code coverage via SonarCloud analysis.
For more details, please see our [guidelines](https://github.com/powsybl/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#continuous-integration).
