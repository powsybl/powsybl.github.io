<h1>Technical Charter</h1>

This charter (the “Charter”) sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the PowSyBl project, which has been established as PowSyBl a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”). LF Projects, LLC (“LF Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All contributors to the Project must comply with the terms of this Charter.

<h2>1. Mission and Scope of the Project</h2>
a. The mission of the Project is to build a modular, high performance, and industrial grade open source framework for the modeling, simulation and analytics of power systems (the "Framework"), leveraging reusable components, common APIs and a secure architecture. The Framework is intended to enable the requirements of energy transition and the rapid diffusion of distributed energy resources, and the Project seeks to develop an ecosystem of developers, suppliers, OEMs, systems integrators, and customers all using the Framework.
<br>
<br>
b. The scope of the Project includes software development under an OSI-approved open source license supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source software project.

<h2>2. Technical Steering Committee</h2>
a. The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project.
<br>
<br>
b. The TSC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the “CONTRIBUTING” file within the Project’s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the <a href="https://github.com/powsybl/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">CONTRIBUTING file</a>. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.
<br>
<br>
c. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the <a href="https://github.com/powsybl/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">CONTRIBUTING file</a>. Unless otherwise documented:
<ul>
    <li>
        Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project;
    </li>
    <li>
        Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository; and
    </li>
    <li>
        A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
d. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.
<br>
<br>
e. The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.
<br>
<br>
f. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and the LF Energy Foundation of The Linux Foundation.
