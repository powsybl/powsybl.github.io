PowSyBl Optimizer is a repository to store production-ready optimal power flow optimizers. For now, it contains only one implementation, called OpenReac. OpenReac is a reactive optimal power flow that gives a set of hypotheses for voltage and reactive controls by network equipment such as generators, shunt compensators and transformers. OpenReac can be used for network planning as well as in operation.

## Features

Only OpenReac is available. 

## Getting started

Please refer to [OpenReac readme file](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-optimizer/tree/main/open-reac) to start.
