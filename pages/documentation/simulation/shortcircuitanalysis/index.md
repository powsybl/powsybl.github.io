# Short circuit API

* TOC
{:toc}

## Introduction
When a short circuit occurs in a network, the currents on equipment can be so high that they exceed their rated values.
Simulating faults on the network is important to verify that the short circuits are well detected and do not damage the equipments.

The short circuit API allows to compute the currents and voltages on a network after a fault. 
For the moment, no simulator is available to compute the analysis, but it is possible to plug one to this API.


## Parameters

### Available parameters
The parameters to be used for the short circuit calculation should be defined in the config.yml file. For example, here are some valid short circuit parameters:

```yaml
short-circuit-parameters:
  with-voltage-result: false
  with-feeder-result: true
  with-limit-violations: true
  study-type: TRANSIENT
  with-fortescue-result: false
  min-voltage-drop-proportional-threshold: 20
```

Available parameters in the short circuit API are stored in `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.ShortCircuitParameters`. They are all optional.

**with-limit-violations**

This property indicates whether limit violations should be returned after the computation. The violations that should be used are `LOW_SHORT_CIRCUIT_CURRENT` and `HIGH_SHORT_CIRCUIT_CURRENT`.
It can be used to filter results where the computed short circuit current is too high or too low. The default value is `true`.

**with-fortescue-result**

This property indicates if the computed results, like currents and voltages, should be returned only in three-phased magnitude or detailed with magnitude and angle on each phase.
According to this property, different classes to return results can be used. If it is set to false, the classes `MagnitudeFaultResult`, `MagnitudeFeederResult` and `MagnitudeShortCircuitBusResult` should be used.
If the property is true, the classes `FortescueFaultResult`, `FortescueFeederResult` and `FortescueShortCircuitBusResult` should be used. All these classes are in `com.powsybl.shortcircuit`.
The default value is `true`.

**with-feeder-result**

This property indicates if the contributions of each feeder to the short circuit current at the fault node should be computed. 
If the property is set to true, the results can be stored in class `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.FeederResult`. 
The default value is `true`.

**study-type**

This property indicates the type of short circuit study. It can be:
- `SUB_TRANSIENT`: it is the first stage of the short circuit, right when the fault happens. The subtransient reactance of generators will be used.
- `TRANSIENT`: the second stage of the short circuit, before the system stabilizes. The transient reactance of generators will be used.
- `STEADY_STATE`: the last stage, once all transient effects are gone.

The default value is `TRANSIENT`. The transient and subtransient reactances of the generators are stored in the [short circuit generator extension.](../../grid/model/extensions.md#generator-short-circuit)

**with-voltage-result**

This property indicates if the voltage profile should be computed on every node of the network. The results, if this property is `true`, should be stored in class `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.ShortCircuitBusResult`. The default value is `true`.

**min-voltage-drop-proportional-threshold**

This property indicates a threshold to filter the voltage results. Only the nodes where the voltage drop due to the short circuit is above this property are be kept. 
The voltage drop is calculated as the ratio between the initial voltage magnitude on the node and the voltage magnitude on the node after the fault. The default value is `0`.

### FaultParameters

It is possible to override parameters for each fault by creating an instance of `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.FaultParameters`. This object will take the fault to which it applies and all the parameters
for this specific fault. One `FaultParameters` corresponds to one `Fault`.
A list of `FaultParameters` can be given as an input to the API with specific parameters for one or multiple faults. If a fault has no `FaultParameters` corresponding, then the general parameters will be used.

## Inputs

The API takes as inputs:

**A network**

It is the network on which the computation will be done.

**A list of faults**

The API takes as input a list of faults on which the calculation should be done. Faults on nodes and on lines are supported.
Each fault can either be an instance of `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.BusFault` or `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.BranchFault`.

The attributes to fill of a `BusFault` are:

**A list of FaultParameters**

Optionally, it is possible to specify a list of `FaultParameters`. Each `FaultParameter` will override the default parameters for a given fault.
For more information on parameters, see [above](#faultparameters).

## Outputs
The results of the short circuit analysis are stored in `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.ShortCircuitAnalysisResult`. This class gathers the results for every fault, they are accessible either by the ID of the fault or the ID of the element on which the fault is simulated.
For each fault, an object `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.FaultResult` is returned.

Depending on `with-fortescue-result`, the returned result should either be an instance of `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.MagnitudeFaultResult` or `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.FortescueFaultResult`.

Both classes contain the following attributes:

| Attribute              | Type                        | Unit | Required | Default value | Description                                                                                              |

| shortCircuitBusResults | List<ShortCircuitBusResult> | -    | no       | Empty list    | A list of ShortCircuitBusResult, should be empty if the parameter `with-voltage-result` is set to `false`. |

However, in these classes, the short circuit current and voltage are represented differently.

In `MagnitudeFaultResult`, the additional attributes are:

| Attribute | Type   | Unit | Required | Default value | Description                                                      |

| voltage   | `FortescueValue` | kV   | yes      | -             | The magnitude and angle of the computed short circuit voltage detailed on the three phases |


**The status of the computation**

This status can be:
- `SUCCESS`: the computation went as planned and the results are full considering the parameters.
- `NO_SHORTCIRCUIT_DATA`: this status should be returned if no short circuit data are available in the network, i.e. the subtransient or transient reactance of generators and the minimum and maximum admissible short circuit currents.
- `SOLVER_FAILURE`: the computation failed because of an error linked to the solver.
- `FAILURE`: the computation failed for any other reason.

**FeederResults**

This field contains the contributions of each feeder to the short circuit current as a list. It should only be returned if `with-feeder-result` is set to `true`.
Depending on the value of `with-fortescue-result`, it should be an instance of `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.MagnitudeFeederResult` or `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.FortescueFeederResult`.

The attributes of `MagnitudeFeederResults` are:

| Attribute     | Type   | Unit | Required | Default value | Description                                                                                   |

| current       | double | kA   | yes      | -             | Three-phased current magnitude of the feeder participating to the short circuit current at the fault point | 

The attributes of `FortescueFeederResuts` are:

| Attribute     | Type             | Unit | Required | Default value | Description                                                                                                                   |

| current       | `FortescueValue` | kA   | yes      | -             | Current magnitudes and angles on the three phases of the feeder participating to the short circuit current at the fault point |

**LimitViolations**

This field contains a list of all the violations after the fault. This implies to have defined in the network the maximum or the minimum acceptable short circuit currents on the voltage levels.
Then, with comparing to the computed short circuit current, two types of violations can be created: `LOW_SHORT_CIRCUIT_CURRENT` and `HIGH_SHORT_CIRCUIT_CURRENT`.
This list should be empty if the property `with-limit-violations` is set to `false`.

**ShortCircuitBusResults**

This field contains a list of voltage results on every bus of the network after simulating the fault. It should be empty if `with-voltage-result` is set to `false`.
The value of the property `with-voltage-drop-threshold` allows to filter these results by keeping only those where the voltage drop is higher than this defined threshold.
Depending on the value of `with-fortescue-result`, the list should contain instances of either `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.MagnitudeShortCircuitBusResult` or `com.powsybl.shortcircuit.FortescueShortCircuitBusResult` objects.
